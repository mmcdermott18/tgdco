                        <p class="intro desktop-no-top">Through dispute resolution, CAO works to resolve issues raised in a complaint using a collaborative problem-solving approach. This voluntary process provides opportunities for affected communities and the IFC or MIGA client to engage directly with one another to address environmental and social concerns related to a project.</p>
                        <p>This year, communities together with IFC and MIGA clients all over the world reached significant agreements and milestones through voluntary dispute resolution processes facilitated by CAO. CAO handled 21 cases in varying stages of dialogue in FY2017, with 75 percent of these reaching partial or full agreement, or settlement monitored by CAO. This included agreements in <a href="#cambodia" class="dr-main">Cambodia</a>, <a href="#chad" class="dr-main">Chad</a>, and <a href="#mongolia" class="dr-main">Mongolia</a>.</p>
                        <p>The road to agreement involves effort and commitment by the parties. This work continues after the agreements are signed and the focus moves to implementation and monitoring. Throughout the process, CAO helps provide the appropriate structure and support to the parties. As the parties work to address challenges together, their relationships are often transformed. These elements, and more, are explored below.</p>
                        <div id="dr-step1-anchor"></div>
                        <h3 class="dr-main top-padding">Facilitating Dialogue</h3>
                        <h5>Laying the groundwork</h5>
                        <p>CAO moved six cases through the preparatory phase of dialogue this year, working jointly with communities and companies to develop a platform for effective engagement. This work includes identifying a skilled mediator, determining who the parties will mandate as their representatives, and what principles should guide their engagement. Commonly called “ground rules,” these principles cover aspects such as confidentiality, information sharing, and use of media. During this early engagement, community and company representatives experience the potential of working together and often start to build trust.</p>
                        <p>CAO also worked to build the capacity of the parties in 11 cases <a href="#box-one" class="dr-main">(see box 1)</a>. This included preparing them for joint meetings, and conducting training in communication and negotiation. These activities often continue throughout the dialogue process.</p>
                        <p class="bold dr-main">Ways CAO helped the parties get started this year:</p>
                        <p><strong>Morocco</strong> | Community and company representatives met to exchange information and hear one another’s perspectives, and agreed to engage in a mediated process. <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=244" class="dr-main"><strong>Learn More</strong></a></p>
                        <p><strong>Bangladesh</strong> | CAO provided separate capacity building workshops to the parties to increase their understanding of facilitated negotiation and draw up ground rules. <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=249" class="dr-main"><strong>Learn More</strong></a></p>
                        <p><strong>Indonesia</strong> | The parties met in the presence of a local religious leader to exchange views and agree on a way to resolve concerns related to a hydropower project. <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=247" class="dr-main"><strong>Learn More</strong></a></p>
                        <h5>Finding Solutions Through Dialogue</h5>
                        <p>Once ground rules, scope, and structure are agreed, dialogue can start. Core elements of a dialogue process are that it is voluntary, and the parties &mdash; working with a mediator <a href="#box-two" class="dr-main">(see box 2)</a> &mdash; control design of the process and share responsibility for the outcomes. CAO remains committed to supporting the dialogue provided there is good faith among the parties and satisfactory progress. During this process, relationships are often built that long outlast CAO’s involvement and exit.</p>
                        <p>Six cases reached partial or interim agreements this year, and a further seven were fully settled.</p>
                        <p>Dialogue is ongoing in two cases, and and three where the parties did not reach agreement were transferred to compliance. One of these was in <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=235" class="dr-main">South Africa</a>, where CAO worked with the women of Marikana and Lonmin, a large platinum producer. Through separate and joint meetings, the parties agreed on principles to guide their interaction, including confidentiality, good faith, and respect. While agreement regarding the issues raised in the complaint was not reached, the preparatory stages were important in providing a platform for the parties to interact.</p>
                        <p class="bold dr-main">Interim Agreements Reached</p>
                        <p>Six cases reached partial or interim agreements this year. Highlights include:</p>
                        <p><strong>Albania</strong> | The parties reached interim agreements including an independent study to assess seismic activity and joint monitoring trips to assess environmental impacts of an oil and gas development. <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=197" class="dr-main"><strong>Learn More</strong></a></p>
                        <p><strong>Nicaragua</strong> | A joint agreement was signed in January 2017 between former workers and Montelimar, a sugar producer. Agreed actions include provision of health care and livelihood support to former workers affected by chronic kidney disease. <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/cases/case_detail.aspx?id=242" class="dr-main"><strong>Learn More</strong></a></p>

Following a series of CAO-facilitated meetings, representatives of 11 affected villages, the company, and representatives of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) issued a Joint Statement setting out agreements to address some of the concerns raised in the complaint, including the return of spirit mountains and implementation of an earlier agreement to restore water sources and roadways. The parties agreed to cooperate with the government of Cambodia to enable the full implementation of the Joint Statement and to continue working together through the CAO process to address remaining issues.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold dr-main">A government working group is assisting the parties:</span> The agreements have led to joint field trips of the parties with local authorities, NGO advisors, and CAO to learn about the boundaries of company and village lands.

                        <p>The resolution of issues leading to a signed agreement often builds on sustained efforts by the parties. These efforts continue as the parties work together to implement agreed actions, and overcome early hurdles. Capacity building often continues for community and company representatives because the skills required for implementing an agreement may differ from those needed during the dialogue process. At this stage, CAO also discusses with the parties under what terms CAO can responsibly exit.</p>
                        <p>Understandably, not all cases are resolved. Parties may decide to stop their voluntary engagement at any point in the process for different reasons. In those situations, a case is transferred to CAO’s compliance function. Of the 21 cases in dispute resolution this year, 10 have reached full settlement. For complex agreements, monitoring can take over a year. Three cases were in monitoring throughout the year.</p>

                            <p>CAO’s capacity building work aims to address power imbalances to the extent possible and ensure that parties can participate in the dialogue process. CAO supported the parties with capacity building in 11 cases this year. In most instances, these activities were conducted both for community and company representatives.</p>
                            <p>In Cameroon, where CAO has been facilitating three parallel local mediation processes to address a complaint related to the Chad-Cameroon Pipeline, capacity building efforts have been tailored to the specific needs of the complainants. For example, CAO provided training in 11 villages to help set up a system of communication with the community leaders representing them in the dialogue process.</p>
                            <p>In Indonesia, CAO held a joint training workshop to strengthen communication between the company and the local community to address a complaint related to the Rajamandala hydropower project. The training allowed the parties to agree on a framework for continued communication and collaboration, which was a key element of the parties’ settlement agreement.</p>
                            <p>In Mongolia, CAO has provided training on negotiation, conflict resolution, communication skills, and joint fact-finding to all the parties involved in dialogue related to the Oyu Tolgoi mine. The joint fact-finding activities, which involved independent experts, were instrumental in helping the parties work through disagreements around project impacts.</p>

The parties have tackled issues together related to water, resettlement, economic displacement, human and animal health, cultural heritage, and impacts to rangeland, among others. Outcomes include improved access to information, herders’ ability to tour and inspect the mine site, access to grazing land inside the mine license area, and compensation and livelihood support programs.</p>

The dialogue also resulted in the establishment of a Tri-Partite Council involving herders, local government, and company representatives, which meets regularly to address current and emerging issues.</p>

                            <p>To fill this gap, CAO has conducted workshops for over 120 mediators worldwide since 2013 to help improve capacity and identify professionals to support its work. This year, CAO launched a pilot screening program to expedite identification of these professionals. Using an online platform and purpose built competency criteria, CAO successfully screened 18 mediators from the Asia region. These mediators then participated in a joint training in Myanmar in May 2017 hosted by CAO with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) accountability mechanisms. CAO has also collaborated with donor organizations to create a program where less experienced mediators can observe or “shadow” more seasoned professionals, to ensure that when CAO exits there is local capacity to assist the parties with ongoing dialogue efforts.</p>
