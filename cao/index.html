                        <div class="text">
                            <p class="intro">People are at the heart of the World Bank Group’s efforts to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. To reach these goals, our investments must generate better jobs and lead to improvements in communities. The people in developing countries are our partners in development, and their meaningful participation in our work is critical to achieving our goals.</p>
                            <p>In this context, I emphasize the valued role of the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), an independent mechanism through which people can voice concerns about private sector activities supported by IFC and MIGA. CAO provides a platform for peoples’ grievances to be addressed, and for companies to engage in dialogue with local stakeholders to find joint solutions for problems.</p>
                            <p>CAO also enhances public trust in the World Bank Group by conducting independent reviews of our environmental and social performance. This helps ensure that our policies meet the highest standards. As we learn from these experiences, CAO helps strengthen our development impact in new markets and challenging environments. In short, CAO is part of the value proposition that the World Bank Group&mdash;as a premier development institution&mdash;offers our project beneficiaries, our clients, our partners, our shareholders, and the public. CAO remains a valuable piece of our accountability structure, through which we can provide the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) value that both investors and communities expect from the World Bank Group.</p>
                            <p>CAO’s role remains important as we scale up our efforts to tackle poverty, inequality, and environmental and social sustainability through the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals. To make these goals a reality, the international community recognizes that we must achieve catalytic development solutions by unlocking the trillions of dollars in available private capital. IFC and MIGA will be at the forefront of these efforts as we work with partners to identify private sector opportunities, promote regulatory reforms, and crowd in much-needed investments in infrastructure and other priority sectors.</p>
                            <p>Scaling up development by crowding in private sector investments will require calculated risks in complex environments, including fragile and conflict-affected countries. Managing the impact of projects on people and the environment remains essential. We have strong structures in place to address these risks through our policy framework, citizen feedback mechanisms like CAO, and project-level grievance mechanisms that ensure direct engagement between our clients and the people who are impacted by their activities.</p>
                            <p>I commend CAO for its impactful work this year and thank all those who work with us to promote solutions, accountability, and learning—local communities, companies, civil society organizations, governments, and other stakeholders&mdash;who collectively contribute to our ambitious development goals.</p>

                            <p class="intro">Our 2017 report highlights the breadth of CAO’s work through its dispute resolution, compliance, and advisory functions, as well as its outreach activities. We managed 51 cases in 28 countries this year, of which 12 were new complaints. Complex cases are a consistent feature, and managing this caseload effectively remains a strategic priority for CAO.</p>
                            <p>Our caseload represents just over 1 percent&mdash;a small proportion&mdash;of the overall IFC and MIGA portfolios. We believe these numbers are a healthy sign that people are accessing CAO’s services. However, many communities tell us that they do not have access to information about projects and grievance redress. <a href="outreach/index.html" class="brown">Outreach</a> is therefore an important part of our work, and we engaged over 200 organizations from 20 countries this year.</p>
                            <p>Through <a href="dispute-resolution/index.html" class="brown">dispute resolution</a>, communities and companies all over the world have reached significant agreements through dialogue. Of 21 cases in dispute resolution, 75 percent have reached full or partial agreement since CAO became involved. These include landmark agreements reached in Cambodia, Chad, and Mongolia this year between IFC clients and local communities, which are documented in these pages.</p>
                            <p>CAO published new <a href="compliance/index.html" class="brown">compliance</a> investigations related to IFC investments in the mining sector in Colombia, a port development in Togo, and tea plantations in India. In addition, CAO issued an enhanced monitoring report on IFC’s investments through financial intermediaries. IFC has acknowledged learning from these and other cases with new procedures and guidance.</p>
                            <p>CAO rolled out its <a href="https://www.cao-grm.org/" class="brown">Grievance Mechanism Toolkit</a> this year, which is a practical resource to help companies implement effective project-level grievance mechanisms. Other <a href="advisory/index.html" class="brown">advisory</a> work focused on lessons learned from agribusiness investments, including advice on supply chains.</p>
                            <p>To address concerns about complainant safety, CAO has produced an <a href="http://www.cao-ombudsman.org/newsroom/documents/CAOApproachtoReprisals.htm" class="brown"><i>Approach to Responding to Concerns of Threats and Incidents of Reprisals in CAO Operations</i></a>. The process involved public consultation with around 20 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and external experts, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. The approach will be publicly released later this year.</p>
                            <p>We continue to diversify CAO’s expertise, adding new staff to our dispute resolution and compliance teams, bringing the in-house team to 21 staff from 16 countries. We are also developing a cadre of qualified regional mediators to decentralize our response.</p>
                            <p>IFC and MIGA have ambitious development goals, particularly in fragile and frontier markets. CAO has a crucial role in continuing to provide a space for communities to raise their voices and promote the resolution of disputes, robust implementation of standards, and learning from experience.</p>
                            <p>I recognize the trust placed in CAO by communities, and the commitment of IFC and MIGA clients and staff to address issues through a CAO process. Together, despite the challenges, we have a shared purpose to deliver better projects and stronger development outcomes for people.</p>

                            <p><strong>Operational Budget</strong><br>In FY2017, CAO had an operational budget of US$5,375,718, of which CAO expensed 99.9 percent. CAO’s operational budget covers the costs of staff salaries, consultants, travel, communications, contractual services, and other administrative expenses. It is funded by IFC and MIGA on a cost-sharing basis.</p>
                            <p><strong>Contingency Fund</strong><br>CAO’s Environmental/Social Mediation and Conflict Resolution Contingency Fund is available for specific, multiyear case requirements under dispute resolution. The Contingency Fund is $1&nbsp;million annually. When the Contingency Fund was established in 2003, IFC committed to contribute 80 percent ($800,000) of the $1&nbsp;million, with MIGA contributing 20 percent ($200,000) each year. In addition to IFC’s contribution, CAO drew down $107,895 of MIGA’s assigned contribution to the Fund this year and expensed 100 percent of those funds.</p>
